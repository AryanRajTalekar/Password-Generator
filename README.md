# 🔐 Password Generator (React)

A **simple yet effective password generator** built with React, designed to demonstrate the practical use of essential React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on way to learn and apply core React hooks in a meaningful context.

### React Hooks Used:

- `useState`: To manage the password, its length, and the toggles for including numbers and special characters.
- `useEffect`: To automatically regenerate the password whenever options are changed.
- `useRef`: To reference the password input and focus/select it after copying.
- `useCallback`: To memoize the `passwordGenerator` and `copyToClipboard` functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Adjustable password length using a slider
- 🔁 Option to include numbers and special characters
- 📋 One-click password copy to clipboard
- 🎯 Auto-select input on copy for better UX
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look
